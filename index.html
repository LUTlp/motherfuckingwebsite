    <title> Presque Motherfucking Website</title>
</head>

<body>
    <header>
        <h1>This is <span class="italique">still </span> a motherfucking website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</aside>
    </header>

        <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

        <h3> 7 fucking declarations. </h3>
        <p>That's how much CSS it look to turn that <a href="motherfuckingwebsite.com" >grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still as all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shit's <span class="italique">still </span> lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li><span class="italique">Still </span> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li><span class="italique">still </span> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's <span class="italique">still </span>accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's <span class="italique">still </span> legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

        <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to imrove readability on your site. <br>
          Here's how</p>

        <h2>Let it breathe</h2>

            <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash --picka minimum line-height : 1.4 for body copy.<br>
        Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>

        <h2>A little less contrastt</h2>

            <p>Black on white. How often do yu see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if A wasn't so focused on keeping to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

        <h2>Size Matters</h2>

            <p> I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not for screen</p>

        <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

            <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

        <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

          <p>I love what the creator of<a href="motherfuckingwebsite.com">  this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
